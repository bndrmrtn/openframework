# Welcome to OpenFramework!

## Create PHP Apps in a faster way

With openframework, you can build your applications and apps faster than you think.
Works with built-in user management that you can turn on and off, as well as authentic email verifications. Create routes quickly, set user authentication needs, etc.

## dev PHP File

Usage:
```php
php dev ...args
```
Using it to make the framework even faster to use.
You can use it to start the development server, create models, database tables or run common database management commands.

## Config File (.env.php)

In this file you can configure how the framework works (may contain sensitive data, e.g. database access codes, etc.)

## Folder System

In normal use, the use of 3 folders will be of interest.

1. /app
2. /routes
3. /views

After learning about these folders, you can code faster than in plain php. The framework is slim so it can fit in almost any small repository, and there's less coding to do.

## Start the development

To start your dev server, run this command in your terminal (Make sure you are in the framework's directory):
```php
php dev serve
```

Then you can start development via the link provided.
