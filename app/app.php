 *      This isn't a required file, you could delete it             *
 *      This file runs after the app loaded all the resources       *
 *      And before the app starts to streaming,                     *
 *      Sometimes it's useful for development                       *
 *                                                                  *

 *      Example: dump all the framework included files to check if  *
 *      your custom helper file is included or not                  *
 *                                                                  *
